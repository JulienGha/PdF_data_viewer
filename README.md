# PdF_data_viewer

Project that allows to spilt and vizualize document in 3d. 

It also use clustering with HDBSCAN on x and y to extract themes from clusters. The z axis correspond to the spliting of document in their order (document1 into n part).

Need a project structure like that for directories:
- data
  - pdf
  - raw
- models
  - bert
- src
